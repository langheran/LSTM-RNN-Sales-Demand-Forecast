abstract = {The demand forecasting technique which is modeled by artificial intelligence approaches using artificial neural networks. The consumer product causers the difficulty in forecasting the future demand and the accuracy of the forecast In performance of the artificial neural network an advantage in a constantly changing business environment and demand forecasting an organization in order to make right decisions regarding manufacturing and inventory management. The learning algorithm of the prediction is also imposed to better prediction of time series in future. The prediction performance of recurrent neural networks a simulated time series data and a practical sales data have been used. This is because of influence of several factors on demand function in retail trading system. It was also observed that as forecasting period becomes smaller, the ANN approach provides more accuracy in forecast.},

@article{Taghizadeh2017,
abstract = {One key requirement for effective supply chain management is the quality of its inventory management. Various inventory management methods are typically employed for different types of products based on their demand patterns, product attributes, and supply network. In this paper, our goal is to develop robust demand prediction methods for weather sensitive products at retail stores. We employ historical datasets from Walmart, whose customers and markets are often exposed to extreme weather events which can have a huge impact on sales regarding the affected stores and products. We want to accurately predict the sales of 111 potentially weather-sensitive products around the time of major weather events at 45 of Walmart retails locations in the U.S. Intuitively, we may expect an uptick in the sales of umbrellas before a big thunderstorm, but it is difficult for replenishment managers to predict the level of inventory needed to avoid being out-of-stock or overstock during and after that storm. While they rely on a variety of vendor tools to predict sales around extreme weather events, they mostly employ a time-consuming process that lacks a systematic measure of effectiveness. We employ all the methods critical to any analytics project and start with data exploration. Critical features are extracted from the raw historical dataset for demand forecasting accuracy and robustness. In particular, we employ Artificial Neural Network for forecasting demand for each product sold around the time of major weather events. Finally, we evaluate our model to evaluate their accuracy and robustness.},

@article{HaiderKhan2011,
abstract = {Share Market is an untidy place for predicting since there are no significant rules to estimate or predict the price of share in the share market. Many methods like technical analysis, fundamental analysis, time series analysis and statistical analysis etc are all used to attempt to predict the price in the share market but none of these methods are proved as a consistently acceptable prediction tool. Artificial Neural Network (ANN), a field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), is a popular way to identify unknown and hidden patterns in data which is suitable for share market prediction. For predicting of share price using ANN, there are two modules, one is training session and other is predicting price based on previously trained data. We used Backpropagation algorithm for training session and Multilayer Feedforward network as a network model for predicting price. In this paper, we introduce a method which can predict share market price using Backpropagation algorithm and Multilayer Feedforward network.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a methodology to define an optimal pricing strategy for convenience stores based on dimension reduction methods and uncertainty of data. The solution approach involves a multiple linear regression (MLR) as well as a linear programming optimization model. Two strategies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Best subset Regression (BSR) methods for the selection of a set of variables among a large number of predictors is presented. A linear optimization model then is solved using diverse business rules. To show the value of the proposed methodology optimal prices calculation results are compared with previous results obtained in a pilot performed for selected stores. This strategy provides an alternative solution that shows how a decision maker can include proper business rules of their particular environment in order to define a pricing strategy that meets business goals.},

@article{Greff2017,
abstract = {Several variants of the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture for recurrent neural networks have been proposed since its inception in 1995. In recent years, these networks have become the state-of-the-art models for a variety of machine learning problems. This has led to a renewed interest in understanding the role and utility of various computational components of typical LSTM variants. In this paper, we present the first large-scale analysis of eight LSTM variants on three representative tasks: speech recognition, handwriting recognition, and polyphonic music modeling. The hyperparameters of all LSTM variants for each task were optimized separately using random search, and their importance was assessed using the powerful fANOVA framework. In total, we summarize the results of 5400 experimental runs ({\$}\backslashapprox 15{\$} years of CPU time), which makes our study the largest of its kind on LSTM networks. Our results show that none of the variants can improve upon the standard LSTM architecture significantly, and demonstrate the forget gate and the output activation function to be its most critical components. We further observe that the studied hyperparameters are virtually independent and derive guidelines for their efficient adjustment.},
